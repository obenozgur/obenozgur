### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Oben, a **MSc student at Aalto University** in Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

I have interned as a software engineer at various companies since 2021 in different industries. Moreover, I had some research experience in the intersection of AI and neuroscience.

I mostly have experience with **Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Unity, C#** with some background in **C++** through university projects.

My desire is to contribute to the solution of **challenging software and data problems by compelling practices of science and engineering**.
